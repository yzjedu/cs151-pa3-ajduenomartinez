### Objective:
#### What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
In this PA we were meant to create a program that outputted different types of ASCII art.
### Procedure:
#### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
1. The first thing I did was read the readme and decide how I wanted to create the functions.
2. Then I began to write out the code for the program, making sure that each function works properly.

#### What were the Key concepts explored?
The Key concepts explored in this PA were creating and calling functions in a program.

### Results:
#### Did your results match what you expected to get?
The results the program gives match what I was expecting, so I would say yes.

### Reflection:
#### What challenges did you encounter?
Creating the ASCII art was a bit hard, but I also found it entertaining.

#### How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
I thoroughly read the readme file, I made sure that I included comments about the functions and made 
variable names understandable, and I practiced with functions in the previous labs.

#### Did you overcome them, and how?
I overcame making the ASCII art purely through trial and error. It took a lot of work making sure that the 
characters went where I wanted them to.

#### Any key takeaways?
ASCII art is really fun to make.

#### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this PA?
This PA helped with my understanding of functions, so I'd say yes.

#### What was it like working by yourself?
It was nice. This PA being a shorter one and being something like making ASCII art made it really fun, and I likely
wouldn't have enjoyed working on this PA as much if it were a lab.
